# Password Cracker (Dictionary Attack) - MD5 Hash Cracking

This is a Python-based **MD5 hash cracker** that uses a dictionary attack method to find the plaintext password from its MD5 hash. The cracker compares the MD5 hash of each password in a wordlist file and checks if it matches the provided hash.

## Features
- **Dictionary-based Attack**: Uses a wordlist file to attempt cracking the MD5 hash.
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Passwords are encoded to bytes using UTF-8 before hashing.
- **MD5 Hash Cracking**: Supports MD5 hash comparison.
- **File Handling**: Reads passwords from a wordlist file and checks each one.
